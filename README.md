**An asynchronous Python wrapper for https://dictionaryapi.dev/**

**You can find the API's repository [here](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/freeDictionaryAPI)**

**NOTE: Currently I have only implemented fetching words from English, not other languages. Support for different languages coming soon.**

___
## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or above
- aiohttp (python -m pip install aiohttp)
    - Used for web requests to the API

That's it!



## Installation
___
Currently through pip.

- `pip install asyncdictionary.py`

Or through git, but why would you want to do that.
- `pip install git+https://github.com/Ay-355/asyncdictionary`

Note that if you don't have python in your PATH variable, you will have to prefix these with `python -m ` or `py -m ` or the equivalent of that on your machine.



## Issues
___
**Any issues directly with the API should be reported at the [API's repository page](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/freeDictionaryAPI).**

If there is anything wrong with this package, feel free to open up an issue.
